      "Socrates, born in Athens around 470 BCE, is often regarded as the father of Western philosophy. Known for his relentless questioning and his method of dialectic inquiry‚Äînow called the Socratic method‚Äîhe sought to challenge assumptions and clarify moral concepts. Socrates never wrote anything himself, and his thoughts were primarily preserved through the writings of his student, Plato. He was sentenced to death for allegedly corrupting the youth of Athens and impiety, choosing to drink poison rather than escape. His legacy is an enduring symbol of the pursuit of truth and intellectual integrity.",
